This is a program that sniffs packets on your network. 
You can choose what interface to sniff on, by inputing the number associated with each interface when the program prompts for your input.
NOTE: This program does not decode the layers, it "dumps" the raw hex bytes, then converts it to their equivalent
characters if and only if they are in the printable ascii range(prints out fullstop(.), if they are not.
